# End-to-end-ML-with-Amazon-Sagemaker <br>

## Project Overview
This repository showcases an in-depth exploration of Amazon SageMaker's capabilities. The primary focus of the project was a binary classification task using a dataset consisting of 45,000 rows and 16 columns. Leveraging 

- XGBoost
- Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebook
- Amazon SageMaker Autopilot
- Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor
- AWS S3
- Streamlit

an end-to-end machine learning pipeline was implemented. The model used in this project achieved 82% validation accuracy and demonstrated how SageMaker simplifies the entire machine learning process, from data preparation to model development, training, deployment, and monitoring. SageMaker Autopilot's no-code approach was also highlighted, automating key aspects of the workflow, making machine learning accessible to users with varying expertise levels.

## Key Highlights
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline with 82% validation accuracy.
- SageMaker simplifies the machine learning process, offering a comprehensive platform.
- SageMaker Autopilot automates feature engineering, data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
- Real-time prediction application using Streamlit.
